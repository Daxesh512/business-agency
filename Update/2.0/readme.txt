Instruction to update the project to 2.0

1. Please replace the "application", "assets" folder with its contents.

2. Go to phpmyadmin or your database client. Delete and import "database.sql" tables from the database.

**Please take a backup first of everything including the database. Lots of features has been optimized. So the new database is required.

Cheers!
